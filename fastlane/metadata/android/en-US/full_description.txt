Please note that this is a very early alpha version. Use at your own risk! This app can generally be used, but you probably will encounter some bugs, some of which are very confusing, others are annoying or maybe even make it un-usable.

Entirely freeze all background activities of apps.

Greenify is another app that can do this, but it is not Open Source.

Contributions are very welcome.

SuperFreezZ is not yet another task manager promising to delete 10GB of data per month or making your device 2x as fast. This is impossible. You should freeze only
* apps that you do not trust (and do not want to run in background) and 
* apps that you use very few.

If you freeze apps that you use daily, the battery of your device will drain faster and these apps will take longer to load. You should take the name seriously: SuperFreezZ will super freeze your apps, and it is not that easy to defrost them.

Features:

* Optionally works without accessibility service as this slows down the device
* Option to freeze only apps that you did not use for a week
