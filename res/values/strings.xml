	<string name="accessibility_service_description">Enabling this makes it possible to automate the freezing of apps.\n\nThis has the following advantages:\n - The user does not have to do this himself: It is way faster and the user does not have to care about how to do it.\n - Users with physical disabilities just need to start the shortcut "autofreeze" (by speech recognition, for example). Then they can freeze all apps automatically. \n\nSuperFreezZ just uses the accessibility service to tap on "Force Stop", "OK", "Back" and to evaluate the result of these interactions.</string>
